  The current element is established with the first call to element() and is \
  maintained across subsequent calls.

no-declared-method=Class %s does not declare method '%s'.
class-not-transformed=Class %s was not transformed for use as a component; this can happen if it is an interface, or was not in a package subject to component transformation.

  You should change these fields to private, and add accessor methods if needed.

comp-type-conflict=Embedded component '%s' provides a type attribute in the template ('%s') as well as in the component class ('%s'). \
  You should not provide a type attribute in the template when defining an embedded component within the component class.
no-type-for-embedded-component=Embedded component '%s' has no type. You should specify a type in the component template, \
  or define the component inside class %s using the @Component annotation on a private instance variable.
embedded-components-not-in-template=Embedded component(s) %s are defined within component class %s (or a super-class of %s), but are not present in the component template (%s).

could-not-resolve-mixin-type=Unable to resolve '%s' to a mixin class name.  Available mixin types: %s.
parameter-name-must-be-unique=Parameter names are required to be unique.  Parameter '%s' already has the value '%s'.
page-is-dirty=Page %s is dirty, and will be discarded (rather than returned to the page pool).
component-instance-is-not-a-page=Component %s was returned from an event handler method, but is not a page component. The page containing the component will render the client response.
failure-reading-messages=Unable to read message catalog from %s: %s
unknown-asset-prefix=Unknown prefix for asset path '%s'.
asset-does-not-exist=Unable to locate asset '%s' (the file does not exist).
wrong-asset-digest=The asset digest in the request does not match the actual digest for asset '%s'. This indicates that the content of the asset has changed between requests. 
unknown-validator-type=Unknown validator type '%s'.  Configured validators are %s.
validator-specification-parse-error=Unexpected character '%s' at position %d of input string: %s
unknown-translator-type=Unknown translator type '%s'.  Configured translators are %s.
missing-from-environment=No object of type %s is available from the Environment.  Available types are %s.
invalid-component-event-result=A component event handler method returned the value %s. Return type %s can not be handled.  Configured return types are %s.

attribute-not-allowed=Element <%s> does not support any attributes.
parameter-element-name-required=The name attribute of the <parameter> element must be specified.
missing-application-state-persistence-strategy=No application state persistence strategy is available with name '%s'. Available strategies: %s.

method-not-found=No public method '%s' in class %s (within property expression '%s').
no-such-property=Class %s does not contain a property named '%s' (within property expression '%s').  Available properties: %s.
write-only-property=Property '%s' of class %s (within property expression '%s') is not readable (it has no read accessor method).
request-exception=Processing of request failed with uncaught exception: %s
component-recursion=The template for component %s is recursive (contains another direct or indirect reference to component %<s). \
  This is not supported (components may not contain themselves).
client-state-must-be-serializable=State persisted on the client must be serializable, but %s does not implement the Serializable interface.

  or in the associated component message catalog as key '%s' or key '%s'. 
resource-access-forbidden=URI %s may not be accessed remotely.
no-markup-from-page-render=Page %s did not generate any markup when rendered. This could be because its template file could not be located, or because a \
  render phase method in the page prevented rendering.
base-class-in-wrong-package=Base class %s (super class of %s) is not in a controlled package and is therefore not valid. You should try moving the class to package %s.

invalid-block-id=Block id '%s' is not valid; block ids must be valid Java identifiers: start with a letter, and consist of letters, numbers and underscores. 
page-pool-exausted=The page pool for page '%s' (in locale %s) has been exausted: there are %d instances currently being used and no more can be created. \
  Try increasing the hard limit (symbol tapestry.page-pool.hard-limit) to allow additional instances to be created, \
  or increasing the soft wait (symbol tapestry.page-pool.soft-wait) to trade away some throughput for more efficient use of page instances.
unknown-null-field-strategy-name=Unrecognized name '%s' locating a null field strategy.  Available strategies: %s.

field-already-claimed=Field %s of class %s is already claimed by %s and can not be claimed by %s.
no-declared-method=Class %s does not declare method '%s'.

  You should change these fields to private, and add accessor methods if needed.  
mixins-invalid-without-id-or-type=You may not specify mixins for element <%s> because it does not represent a component (which requires either an id attribute or a type attribute).
binding-source-failure=Could not convert '%s' into a component parameter binding: %s
page-name-unresolved=Unable to resolve class name %s to a logical page name.
context-index-out-of-range=Method %s has more parameters than there are context values for this component event.

asset-does-not-exist=Unable to locate asset '%s' (the file does not exist).

unknown-translator-type=Unknown translator type '%s'.  Configured translators are %s.

request-exception=Processing of request failed with uncaught exception: %s
component-recursion=The template for component %s is recursive (contains another direct or indirect reference to component %<s). \
  This is not supported (components may not contain themselves).
client-state-must-be-serializable=State persisted on the client must be serializable, but %s does not implement the Serializable interface.
corrupt-client-state=Serialized client state was corrupted. \
  This may indicate that too much state is being stored, which can cause the encoded string to be truncated by the client web browser.

  or in the associated component message catalog as key '%s' or key '%s'.

  Try increasing the hard limit (symbol tapestry.page-pool.hard-limit) to allow additional instances to be created, \
  or increasing the soft wait (symbol tapestry.page-pool.soft-wait) to trade away some throughput for more efficient use of page instances.
unknown-null-field-strategy-name=Unrecognized name '%s' locating a null field strategy.  Available strategies: %s.
no-translator-for-type=No translator is defined for type %s.  Registered types: %s.

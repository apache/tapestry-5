 * A source for {@link org.apache.tapestry.PropertyConduit}s, which can be thought of as a compiled property path
 * expression. PropertyConduits are the basis of the "prop:" binding factory, thus this service defines the expression
 * format used by the {@link org.apache.tapestry.internal.bindings.PropBindingFactory}.
 * <p/>
 * The expression consist of one or more terms, seperated by periods. Each term may be either the name of a JavaBean
 * property, or the name of a method (a method that takes no parameters). Method names are distinguished from property
 * names by appending empty parens. Using a method term as the final term will make the expression read-only.
 * <p/>
 * Alternately, the seperator between property names may be "?." (i.e., "user?.name").  This allows an "if not null"
 * connection: if the term is null, then the expression evaluates to null, otherwise, the expression evaluation
 * continues to the next property.  The helps avoid NullPointerExceptions.

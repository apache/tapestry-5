/**
 * A marker annotation applied to a mixin to indicate that the mixin's render state behavior is deferred until after the
 * the behavior of the component to which the mixin is attached. Normally, mixins occur before the component. This
 * divides each phase in the render state machine into three virtual phases: before the component, the component itself,
 * and after the component.

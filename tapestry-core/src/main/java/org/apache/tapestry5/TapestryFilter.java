/**
 * The TapestryFilter is responsible for intercepting all requests into the web application. It
 * identifies the requests
 * that are relevant to Tapestry, and lets the servlet container handle the rest. It is also
 * responsible for
 * initializing Tapestry.
 *
 * The application is primarily configured via context-level init parameters.
 *
 * <dl>
 * <dt>tapestry.app-package</dt>
 * <dd>The application package (used to search for pages, components, etc.)</dd>
 * </dl>
 *
 * In addition, a JVM system property affects configuration: <code>tapestry.execution-mode</code>
 * (with default value "production"). This property is a comma-separated list of execution modes.
 * For each mode, an additional init parameter is checked for:
 * <code>tapestry.<em>mode</em>-modules</code>; this is a comma-separated list of module class names
 * to load. In this way, more precise control over the available modules can be obtained which is
 * often needed during testing.

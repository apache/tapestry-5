/**
 * Marks a method as a handler for a client side event. The handler method will be invoked when a component triggers an
 * event. Filters on the type of event and on the originating component ensure that only the appropriate methods are
 * invoked.
 * <p/>
 * Client events include a <em>context</em> of one or more values. These context values are included in the action URI.
 * The values are optionally supplied to the handler method as parameters. Automatic {@linkplain
 * org.apache.tapestry5.ValueEncoder conversion} from string to the type of the actual parameter occur.
 * <p/>
 * Handlers may return a value. Returning a non-null value will abort the handling of the event, and will usually
 * control the response sent to the client web browser. The details are somewhat specific to the type of event and the
 * component involved.
 * <p/>
 * If a handler is not found within the originating component (or no handler aborts the event handling), then handlers
 * within the containing component will be searched. This continues up the page hierarchy. In some cases, having no
 * handlers (or no aborting handlers) is considered acceptible; in others, it is an error. Again, this is defined by the
 * type of originating component, and the type of event.
 * <p/>
 * <strong>If you fail to provide filters on either component or event type, then your method will be invoked for all
 * component events, possibly including events that bubble up from embedded sub-components. </strong>

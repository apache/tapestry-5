 * Used to automatically include a CSS stylesheet when rendering the page.  The value is an asset reference; relative
 * paths are relative to the Java class, or a "context:" prefix can be used to reference resources in the web
 * application.
 * <p/>
 * This saves the work of injecting the asset into a field and injecting the PageRenderSupport environmental service,
 * and invoking the method.
 * <p/>
 * Does not support setting a media type; if that is required. use {@link org.apache.tapestry.RenderSupport#addStylesheetLink(org.apache.tapestry.Asset,
 * String)} directly.

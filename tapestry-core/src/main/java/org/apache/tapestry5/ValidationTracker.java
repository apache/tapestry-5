/**
 * Tracks information related to user input validations. This information is: <ul> <li>The input values provided by the
 * user. <li>Any validation exceptions associated with input fields. </ul>
 * <p/>
 * The tracker must differentiate between components (which will implement the {@link Field} interfaces) and fields. It
 * is a one to many relationship, because each field may be called upon to render itself multiple times within a
 * request, because of {@link Loop} or other similar components.
 * <p/>
 * Internally, the tracker indexes its information in terms of the {@linkplain Field#getControlName() control name} for
 * each rendering of the component (the mechanics of Tapestry ensures that this is unique within the form).
 * <p/>
 * Validation trackers must be serializable, as they will almost always be stored into the HttpSession.
 * <p/>
 * Trackers are used by only a single form within a single page; they are not threadsafe.

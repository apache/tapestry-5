/**
 * Resolves page names and component types to fully qualified class names. Pages and components may be provided by the
 * application or inside a <em>mapped package</em>. Page names often appear inside URLs, and component types often
 * appear in component templates (when specifying the type of an embedded component).
 *
 * The service is configured using a collection of {@link LibraryMapping}s. Each mapping maps a prefix, such as "core"
 * to a root package name, such as "org.apache.tapestry5.corelib". The root package is expected to have sub-packages:
 * "pages", "components", "mixins" and "base" ("base" is for base classes).
 *
 * The resolver performs a search of the classpath (via {@link ClassNameLocator}), to build up a set of case-insensitive
 * maps from logical page name, component type, or mixin type to fully qualified class name.
 *
 * Certain ambiguities occur if mapped packages overlap, either in terms of the the prefixes or the package names. Keep
 * things clearly separate to avoid lookup problems.

/**
 * A high level description of a group of related JavaScript libraries and stylesheets. The built-in "core"
 * stack is used to define the core JavaScript libraries needed by Tapestry (though this has been largely replaced by
 * JavaScript modules in Tapestry 5.4,
 * and the may be no libraries in the core stack by Tapestry 5.5). Other component libraries may
 * define additional stacks for related sets of resources, for example, to bundle together some portion
 * of the ExtJS or YUI libraries.
 *
 * The JavaScript assets of a stack may (when {@linkplain SymbolConstants#COMBINE_SCRIPTS enabled}) be exposed to the
 * client as a single URL (identifying the stack by name). The individual JavaScript  assets are combined into a single virtual
 * asset, which is then streamed to the client. The individual JavaScript libraries, or the combined virtual library,
 * may be {@linkplain SymbolConstants#MINIFICATION_ENABLED minimized} and the content (both compressed and
 * uncompressed) cached.
 *
 * Implementations may need to inject the {@link ThreadLocale} service in order to determine the current locale (if any
 * of the JavaScript library or stylesheet assets are localized). They will generally need to inject the
 * {@link AssetSource} service as well.
 *
 * The {@link ExtensibleJavaScriptStack} is the best way to create new stacks.
 *
 * @see ThreadLocale
 * @see org.apache.tapestry5.services.javascript.ExtensibleJavaScriptStack

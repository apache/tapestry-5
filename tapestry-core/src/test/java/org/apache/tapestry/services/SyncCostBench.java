/**
 * Tests single-thread synchronization overhead using different techniques. Note that we're fudging
 * things a bit by getting a read lock for a write operation .... it's just that I'm more concerned
 * about read locks (which will be very common) than about write locks (very rare). Another concern
 * is that hotspot is going to mess up our synchronization when it see we're not really doing
 * anything multi-threaded.
 * <p/>
 * The results show that using the {@link org.apache.tapestry.internal.annotations.Concurrent}
 * aspect (which used a {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock} under the covers)
 * is about 4x as expensive as just using the synchronized keyword. There are some anomolous results
 * ... for example, ReadWriteLockRunner is consistently slower than ReadWriteLockAspectRunner (one
 * would expect it to be the other way around ... must be something about how AspectJ weaves the
 * code ... and it's use of static methods in many cases).
 * <p/>
 * Well, the Concurrent aspect is gone, replaced with the {@link ConcurrentBarrier} utility.

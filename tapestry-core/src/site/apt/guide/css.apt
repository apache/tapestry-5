Tapestry CSS Support

  Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is an important technology, even with Tapestry.  Tapestry works best when the
  rendered HTML is simple and semantic -- semantic meaning HTML that goes back to its roots, simple, straightforward,
  with tags used for structure and, as much as possible, details about font, color and layout delegated to CSS.

Default CSS Stylesheet

  Tapestry includes a built-in stylesheet, default.css, is all HTML documents (documents that have an outer
  \<html\> element and a nested \<head\> element).  The default.css stylesheet is always ordered <first> ... any additional stylesheets
  will come after.  This allows Tapestry's default styles to be overridden.

  All the styles in the default stylesheet are prefixed with "t-" (for Tapestry).

Adding your own CSS

  A page or component that is rendering the \<head\> tag can add a stylesheet directly in the markup.

+---+
<head>
  <link href="/css/myapp.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>
  . . .
+---+

  If you want to leverage Tapestry's localization support, you may want to make use of an expansion and the asset: binding prefix:


+---+
<head>
  <link href="${asset:context:css/myapp.css}" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>
  . . .
+---+

  The "asset:" prefix means that the remainder of the expansion is a path to a resource.  The "context:" part
  indicates that it should look for the resource in the web application root (src/main/webapp in your workspace).  If you
  left this out, it would look for the file on the classpath, relative to the component's Java class.

Using the IncludeStylesheet Annotation

 Another approach to adding a stylesheet is to include an
 {{{../../apidocs/org/apache/tapestry/annotation/IncludeStylesheet.html}IncludeStylesheet}} annotation on your component class:

+---+
@IncludeStylesheet("context:css/myapp.css")
public class MyComponent
{

}
+---+

 As with  {{{ajax.html}included JavaScript libraries}}, the stylesheet will only be added once,
 regardless of the number of components that include it via the annotation.

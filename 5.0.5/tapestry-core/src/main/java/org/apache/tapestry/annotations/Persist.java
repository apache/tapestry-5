/**
 * Identifies a field as persistent, meaning its value persists from one request to the next.
 * Different strategies exist for how this is accomplished, the most common being the default,
 * "session", which stores the field's value in the {@link Session}.
 * <p>
 * In most cases, the value will be omitted and will default to the empty string. This forces a
 * search for the correct strategy. Starting with the component (or mixin) itself, a check is made
 * for the {@link Meta meta data property} <code>tapestry.persistence-strategy</code>. If a value
 * is found, it is used, otherwise the search continues up the inheritance hierarchy, towards the
 * page. If not found, then the "session" strategy is used.
 * <p>
 * In this way, the session persistence strategy for a component and all of its sub-components can
 * be controlled by the containing component.

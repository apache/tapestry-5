 * Manages a set of {@link org.apache.tapestry.internal.events.UpdateListener}s. Periodically (say, every
 * request during development, or every minute or so during production), request processing is
 * locked down so that only a single thread is active, and the active thread invokes
 * {@link #fireUpdateEvent()}. Various services that are dependent on external resource files (such
 * as classes or template files) can check to see if any file they've used has changed. If so, the
 * service can invalidate its internal cache, or notify other services (typically via
 * {@link org.apache.tapestry.internal.events.InvalidationListener} that they should do the same.

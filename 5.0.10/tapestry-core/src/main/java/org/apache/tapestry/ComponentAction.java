/**
 * An action that is associated with a component. This is used in several areas of Tapestry and is
 * primarily an attempt to externalize state for a component so that it can be recorded outside the
 * object.
 * <p/>
 * ComponentActions should be immutable. They are often created during one request and associated
 * with a particular component instance. They are then used in a later request (with an equivalent
 * component instance).
 * <p/>
 * ComponentActions are serializable (they are often serialized into Base64 strings for storage on
 * the client).

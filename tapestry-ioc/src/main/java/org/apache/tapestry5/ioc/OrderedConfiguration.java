 * Object passed into a service contributor method that allows the method provide contributed values
 * to the service's configuration.
 * <p/>
 * A service can <em>collect</em> contributions in three different ways:
 * <ul>
 * <li>As an un-ordered collection of values</li>
 * <li>As an ordered list of values (where each value has a unique id, pre-requisited and
 * post-requisites)</li>
 * <li>As a map of keys and values
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * The service defines the <em>type</em> of contribution, in terms of a base class or service
 * interface. Contributions must be compatible with the type.

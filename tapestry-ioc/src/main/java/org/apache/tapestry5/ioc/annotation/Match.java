/**
 * Optional, but typically used, annotation for service decorator methods, used to define which services the decorator
 * applies to. This annotation defines a number of <em>patterns</em> that allow services across multiple modules to be
 * selected. A decorator is applied to a service if any of its patterns match the service.
 * <p/>
 * TODO: Describe pattern glob-match syntax
 * <p/>
 * When the Match annotation is not supplied, then the decorator only applies to a single service: the service whose id
 * matches the decorators id; that is, method <code>decorateMyService()</code> would decorate only the service provided
 * by the <code>buildMyService()</code> method, within the same module.

/**
 * Creates a "shadow" of a property of an object. The shadow has the same type as the property, and
 * delegates all method invocations to the property. Each method invocation on the shadow
 * re-acquires the value of the property from the underlying object and delegates to the current
 * value of the property.
 * <p/>
 * Typically, the object in question is another service, one with the "perthread" service lifecycle.
 * This allows a global singleton to shadow a value that is specific to the current thread (and
 * therefore, the current request).

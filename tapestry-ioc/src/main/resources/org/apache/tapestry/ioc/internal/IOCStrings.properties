build-method-conflict=Service building method %s conflicts with (has the same name as, but different parameters than) \
  previously seen method %s and has been ignored.
build-method-wrong-return-type=Method %s is named like a service builder method, \
 but the return type (%s) is not acceptable (try an interface). \
 The method has been ignored.
decorator-method-wrong-return-type=Method %s is named like a service decorator method, \
  but the return type (%s) is not acceptable (try Object). The method has been ignored.
builder-locked=The Registry Builder has created the Registry, further operations are not allowed.
service-wrong-interface=Service '%s' implements interface %s, which is not compatible with the requested type %s.
instantiate-builder-error=Unable to instantiate class %s as a module builder: %s
builder-method-error=Error invoking service builder method %s (for service '%s'): %s
constructor-error=Error invoking constructor %s (for service '%s'): %s
decorator-method-error=Error invoking service decorator method %s (for service '%s'): %s
builder-method-returned-null=Builder method %s (for service '%s') returned null.
no-service-matches-type=No service implements the interface %s.
many-service-matches=Service interface %s is matched by %d services: %s.  \
  Automatic dependency resolution requires that exactly one service implement the interface.
no-services-match-marker=Unable to locate any service assignable to type %s with marker annotation %s.
many-services-match-marker=Unable to locate a single service assignable to type %s with marker annotation %s.  \
 All of the following services match: %s.
unknown-scope=Unknown service scope '%s'.
decorator-method-needs-delegate-parameter=Decorator methods must a parameter for the service delegate \
 (i.e., the object the created interceptor will delegate to). \
 Method %s does not include such a parameter, and has been ignored.
decorator-returned-wrong-type=Decorator method %s (invoked for service '%s') returned %s, \
  which is not assignable to the %s service interface.
creating-service=Creating service '%s'.
invoking-method=Invoking method %s.
invoking-constructor=Invoking constructor %s.
recursive-service-build=Construction of service '%s' has failed due to recursion: \
  the service depends on itself in some way. \
  Please check %s for references to another service that is itself dependent on service '%1$s'.
contribution-wrong-return-type=Method %s is named like a service contributor method, \
  but the return type (%s) is not appropriate (try void). The return value will be ignored.
too-many-contribution-parameters=Service contribution method %s contains more than one parameter of type Configuration, \
  OrderedConfiguration, or MappedConfiguration. Exactly one such parameter is required for a service contribution method. \
  The method has been ignored.
too-many-configuration-parameters=Service builder method %s contains more than one parameter of type \
  Collection, List, or Map. Parameters of this type are the way in which service configuration values, \
  collected from service contributor methods, are provided to the service builder. \
  Services are only allowed a single configuration. Unexpected results or failures may occur.
no-contribution-parameter=Service contribution method %s does not contain a parameter of type \
  Configuration, OrderedConfiguration or MappedConfiguration. This parameter is how the method \
  make contributions into the service's configuration. The method has been ignored.
contribution-method-error=Error invoking service contribution method %s: %s
contribution-was-null=Service contribution (to service '%s', by %s) was null and has been ignored.
contribution-key-was-null=Key for service contribution (to service '%s', by %s) was null and has been ignored.
contribution-wrong-value-type=Service contribution (to service '%s', by %s) was an instance of %s, \
  but %s was expected. The contribution has been ignored.
contribution-wrong-key-type=Key for service contribution (to service '%s', by %s) was an instance of %s, \
  but %s was expected. The contribution has been ignored.
contribution-duplicate-key=Service contribution (to service '%s', by %s) conflicts with \
  existing contribution (by %s) and has been ignored.
generic-type-not-supported=Generic type '%s' is not supported. Only simple parameterized lists are \
  supported.
error-building-service=Error building service proxy for service '%s' (at %s): %s
no-public-constructors=Module builder class %s does not contain any public constructors.
too-many-public-constructors=Module bulider class %s contains more than one public constructor. \
  The first constructor, %s, is being used. \
  You should change the class to have only a single public constructor.
recursive-module-constructor=The constructor for module class %s is recursive: it depends on itself in some way. \
  The constructor, %s, is in some way is triggering a service builder, decorator or contribution method within the class.
constructed-configuration=Constructed configuration: %s
service-construction-failed=Construction of service %s failed: %s
no-such-service=Service id '%s' is not defined by any module.  Defined services: %s.
service-id-conflict=Service id '%s' has already been defined by %s and may not be redefined by %s. \
 You should rename one of the service builder methods.
 no-constructor=Class %s (implementation of service '%s') does not contain any public constructors.
 bind-method-must-be-static=Method %s appears to be a service binder method, but is an instance method, not a static method.
 error-in-bind-method=Error invoking service binder method %s: %s
no-autobuild-constructor=Class %s does not contain a public constructor needed to autobuild.
autobuild-constructor-error=Error invoking constructor %s: %s
overlapping-service-proxy-providers=Setting a new service proxy provider when there's already an existing provider. This may indicate that you have multiple IoC Registries.
unexpected-service-proxy-provider=Unexpected service proxy provider when clearing the provider. This may indicate that you have multiple IoC Registries.
no-proxy-provider=Service token for service '%s' can not be converted back into a proxy because no proxy provider has been registered. This may indicate that an IoC Registry has not been started yet.

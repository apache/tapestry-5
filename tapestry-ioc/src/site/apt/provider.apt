Object Providers

  When you don't provide the {{{../apidocs/org/apache/tapestry5/ioc/annotations/InjectService.html}InjectService}} annotation
  on a parameter (to a service builder method or constructor), Tapestry will
  resolve the parameter automatically.
  
  This is called <object injection>, rather than <service injection>, because the value that will ultimately
  be injected is not necessarily a service; it may be some arbitrary object.
  
  If this sounds vague, its because there is not just one
  {{{../apidocs/org/apache/tapestry5/ioc/ObjectProvider.html}ObjectProvider}}; there's a whole set of them,
  forming a {{{command.html}chain of command}}.  The commands in the chain may provide an object
  based on the parameter type, or based on additional annotations on the parameter.
  
  There are several built-in object providers:
  
  * Check for {{{../apidocs/org/apache/tapestry5/ioc/annotations/Value.html}Value}} annotation

  * Check for {{{../apidocs/org/apache/tapestry5/ioc/annotations/Symbol.html}Symbol}} annotation

  * Check for a <unique> service in the Registry whose service interface matches the parameter type
  
  []
  
  Usually, the @Inject annotation is supplemented by an additional annotation which
  triggers a specific  ObjectProvider to provide the value.
  
@Value Annotation Provider

  The Value annotation
  allows a literal value to be injected.  When combined with 
  {{{symbols.html}symbols}}, they represent a way for parts of the overall service
  network to be spot-configured.  For example:
  
+----+
  public MyService build(@Value("${max-seconds}") long maxSeconds)
  {
    return new MyServiceImpl(maxSeconds);
  }
+----+

  Here, the MyService service requires a configuration of a number of seconds.
  The value is supplied as a symbol, with a factory default that may be overwritten
  with an application default.

  Usually, the symbol reference is only part of the string, i.e. <<<@Value("$\{report.dir}/$\{report.name}.txt")>>>

@Symbol Annotation Provider

   This is closely related to the @Value annotation approach, except that the annotation
   directly specifies a symbol name.

+----+
  public MyService build(@Symbol("max-seconds") long maxSeconds)
  {
    return new MyServiceImpl(maxSeconds);
  }
+----+

Service Provider

  This is always that last object provider checked.
  
  A <single> service must exist whose service interface matches the parameter type.  This is <not> an exact match: a search is made for any and all
  services whose service interface is a super class of the parameter type.  
  
  An exception is thrown if there are no matches, or if there are multiple matches.

  
Alias Object Provider

  The {{{../tapestry-core/}tapestry-core}} module
  defines the 
  {{{../tapestry-core/guide/alias.html}Alias object provider}},
   which is used as a way to override services or
  disambiguate services (when multiple services implement the same interface).  
    
Defining New Providers

  New providers can be specified by contributing to the
  MasterObjectProvider service's configuration.  The configuration
  is mapped, with the keys being the provider prefix, and the values
  being the object provider implementation.
  
  Example:
  
+-----+
  public void contributeMasterObjectProvider(OrderedConfiguration<ObjectProvider> configuration)
  {
    configuration.add("MyObject", new MyObjectProvider());
  }
+-----+

  This establishes a name for the object provider (useful if the exact order of execution of the
  provider, relative to other providers, is relevant). 

  Of course, this is a simplified example. In a real scenario, the provider is most likely
  a service with its own dependencies.

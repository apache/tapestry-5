Upgrade Notes

  This is a quick guide to changes between releases of Tapestry.  This is meant to provide information
  on any additions or changes that developers will face after upgrading to the latest version of Tapestry.

  It is always advised to perform a full and complete build after upgrading.

  You should also check the {{{../release-notes.html}project-wide release notes}} for information
  about bugs fixes and other improvements.

Release 5.0.12

  Several methods of {{{../apidocs/org/apache/tapestry/ioc/services/ClassFabUtils.html}ClassFabUtils}}
  have been removed.  The new method {{{castReference()}}} is an improved replacement for the removed
  methods. These methods were largely used when decorating services, and the new 
  {{{../apidocs/org/apache/tapestry/ioc/services/AspectDecorator.html}AspectDecorator}} is even easier.

  For {{{https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TAPESTRY-2421}TAPESTRY-2421}} (compatibility between
  Tapestry 4 and Tapestry 5), the org.apache.tapestry.ioc.annotations package was renamed
  to org.apache.tapestry.ioc.annotation.

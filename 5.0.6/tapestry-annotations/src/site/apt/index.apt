Tapestry Annotations

 The majority of Tapestry annotations (defined in the {{{.../tapestry-core}tapestry-core}} and {{{.../tapestry-ioc}tapestry-ioc}} modules)
 are very specific to Tapestry components or Tapestry IoC services.
 
 A small number of annotations are intended for data holding classes that are not Tapestry components; these annotations
 allow high-level components such as Grid and BeanEditForm to
 create powerful user interfaces with out any additional coding.
 
 By separating out those annotations from the rest of Tapestry, it is reasonable to includes such annotations inside your 
 data tier classes <without> having to bring all of Tapestry into your classpath.  This is very useful in multi-tier applications
 where data objects may originate in an application tier (such as a JEE application server) and travel to the presentation tier (a Tapestry application).

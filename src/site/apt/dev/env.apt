Development Environment

  Developing Tapestry requires the use of JDK 1.5.
  
  Effectively, you should have the following tools:
  
  * Maven 2.0.9
  
  * Ant 1.7.0
  
  * IDEA IntelliJ

  []

  IntelliJ is available to all Tapestry committers under JetBrains' generous open-source policy.  This is one of the
  perks of being invited as a committer.
  
Builds

  Tapestry 5 is built by Maven 2.
  
  You can build individual modules, or (from the root folder) build everything.

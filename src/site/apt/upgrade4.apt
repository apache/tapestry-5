Upgrading from Tapestry 4 to Tapestry 5
  
 There is no simple, direct upgrade path from Tapestry 4 to Tapestry 5.

 Tapestry 5 represents a completely new code base. Although it maintains the <spirit> of
 Tapestry 4, it is also a quantum leap ahead of Tapestry 4.

 A lot of the familiar aspects of Tapestry are completely different between the two releases.
 In other cases, core concepts remain, but the details, names, and implementations
 have changed.

 As part of {{{https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TAPESTRY-2421}TAPESTRY-2421}}, we've done
 some judicous renaming so that Tapestry 4 and Tapestry 5 applications can run inside the same WAR.


 More to come ...

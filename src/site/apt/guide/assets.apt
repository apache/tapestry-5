Assets

  Assets are any kind of file that may be downloaded to a client web browser in addition to the dynamically generated HTML.
  
  Assets are most often images, stylesheets, and JavaScript libraries.
  
  Normal assets are stored in the web application's context folder ... stored inside the web application WAR file in the ordinary way.
  
  Tapestry will also make files stored <on the classpath>, with your Java class files, visible to the web browser.
  
  Assets are exposed to your code as instances of the {{{../apidocs/org/apache/tapestry5/Asset.html}Asset}} interface.
  
Injecting Assets

  Components learn about assets via injection.  The 
  {{{inject.html}Inject}} annotation allows Assets to be injected into components as read-only properties.  The path to
  the resource is specified using the
  {{{../apidocs/org/apache/tapestry5/annotations/Path.html}Path}} annotation.
  
+----+
  @Inject
  @Path("context:images/tapestry_banner.gif")
  private Asset banner;
+----+

  Assets are located within <domains>; these domains are identified by the prefix on the Inject annotation's value.
  
  If the prefix is omitted, the value will be interpreted as a path relative to the Java class file itself, within
  the "classpath:" domain. This is often used when creating component libraries, where the assets used by the components
  are packaged in the JAR with the components themselves.
  
  Unlike elsewhere in Tapestry, <case matters>. This is because Tapestry is dependenent on the Servlet API and the Java runtime
  to access the underlying files, and those APIs, unlike Tapestry, are case sensitive. Be aware that some <operating systems> (such as Windows)
  are case insenitive, which may mask errors that will be revealed at deployment (if the deployment operating system is case sensitive,
  such as Linux).
  
Relative Assets

  You can use relative paths with domains (if you omit the prefix):

+----+
  @Inject
  @Path("../edit.png")
  private Asset icon;
+----+  

  Since you must omit the prefix, this only makes sense for components packaged in a library for reuse.
  
Symbols For Assets

  {{{../../tapestry-ioc/symbols.html}Symbols}} inside the annotation value are
  expanded. This allows you to define a symbol and reference it as part of the path.  For example, you could contribute
  a symbol named "skin.root" as "context:/skins/basic" and then reference an asset from within it:
  
+----+
  @Inject
  @Path("${skin.root}/style.css")
  private Asset style;
+----+

  An override of the skin.root symbol would affect all references to the named asset.
  
Localization of Assets

  Assets are {{{localization.html}localized}}; Tapestry will search for a variation of the file appropriate
  to the effective locale for the request. In the previous example, a German user of the application may
  see a file named <<<edit_de.png>>> (if such a file exists).
  
New Asset Domains

  If you wish to create new domains for assets, for example to allow assets to be stored on the file system or in a database,
  you may define a new
  {{{../apidocs/org/apache/tapestry5/services/AssetFactory.html}AssetFactory}}
  and contribute it to the AssetSource service configuration.  
  
Simplified Paths

  Private assets (assets on the classpath) normally have the form: <<</assets/foo/bar/Baz.css>>> where <<<Baz.css>>> is a file inside the <<<foo.bar>>> Java package.
  In other words, the package name is converted into a path underneath the virtual folder, <<</assets/>>>.  
  
  You are given some control over this, allowing for shorter paths.  The ClasspathAssetAliasManager service has a mapped configuration. The map keys
  are logical folder names, and the map values are the complete classpath.  For example, Tapestry itself makes a contribution similar to the following:
  
+----+
    public static void contributeClasspathAssetAliasManager(
            MappedConfiguration<String, String> configuration)
    {
        configuration.add("tapestry/5.1", "org/apache/tapestry5");
    }
+---+

  Thus, the generated URLs may say <<</assets/tapestry/5.1/Foo.gif>>> but the underlying file will be <<</org/apache/tapestry5/Foo.gif>>> (within the classpath).
  
  There are built-in contributions for:

  * tapestry/<version>

  * scriptaculous/<version>

  * datepicker/<version>

  * app/<app-version> (for assets obtained at or beneath the application package)

  * classpath/<app-version> (for assets obtained from any otherwise unmapped package)

  []

  Where <version> is the Tapestry framework version, and <app-version> is the application version (which will be a random
  string if not explicitly {{{conf.html}configured}}).

  If you give your application a version number, it is important to change the version number for each deployment. Assets
  within the application (whether in the context, or the classpath) will be given a far-future expires header
  and therefore will be aggresively cached in the client browser. Changing the version number changes the path the browser
  sees, which forces the browser to load the new and changed version of the asset.

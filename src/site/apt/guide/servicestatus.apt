IoC Services Status

  Using Tapestry there will often be a large number of services defined in the registry; a mix of the builtin services provided by the framework
  and your own.
  
  Built in to every Tapestry application is a page, ServiceStatus, that can present this information to you.
  
  The page "ServiceStatus" presents the list of services within the appication's Registry.

  Services may be builtin, defined, virtual or real.
  
  Builtin only applies to a few special services that are part of Tapestry IoC.
  
  Defined services are defined in some module, but have not yet been referenced in any way.
  
  Virtual services have been referenced and have gotten as far as creating a service proxy.
  
  Real services have had methods invoked, this forces the <realization> of the service which includes
  instantiating the service, injecting dependencies, and decorating with any applicable interceptors.

Content Type and Markup Output

  Tapestry reads {{{templates.html}well-formed XML template files}} and renders its output as XML, with minor caveats:

  * The \<?xml\?> XML declaration is omitted.

  * Most element render with an open and close tag, even if empty.

  * Certain elements will be abbreviated to just the open tag, if empty:

    * br

    * hr

    * img

    []

  * \<![CDATA[]\> sections are <<not>> used

  []

  This is all to ensure that the markup stream, while (almost) well formed, is still properly understood by browsers
  expecting ordinary HTML.

  In fact, Tapestry may decide to render a purely XML document; it depends on the content type of the response.
  The default content type for pages is "text/html" ... this triggers specialized XML rendering.

  A page may declare its content type using the {{{../apidocs/org/apache/tapestry5/annotations/ContentType.html}ContentType}}
  class annotation.  Content types other than "text/html" will render as well-formed XML documents, including the
  XML declaration, and more standard behavior for empty elements.

Input/Output Character Set

  The character set (aka character encoding) used when writing output and when parsing requests is normally "utf-8".
  All pages use the same encoding, which can be set using the
  <<<tapestry.charset>>>
  {{{conf.html}configuration setting}}.

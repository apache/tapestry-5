/**
 * Marker annotation placed on fields whose value should be retained past the end of the request. This is most often
 * associated with fields that are <em>lazily loaded</em>. By marking such fields with the Retain annotation, the fields
 * will <em>not</em> be discarded at the end of the request.
 * <p/>
 * This is quite different from {@link Persist}, because the value that's allowed to be retained is not stored
 * persistently; it is simply not cleared out. A subsequent request, even from the same user, may be processed by a
 * different instance of the page where the value is still null.
 * <p/>
 * This annotation should only be used with lazily-evaluated objects that contain no client-specific information.

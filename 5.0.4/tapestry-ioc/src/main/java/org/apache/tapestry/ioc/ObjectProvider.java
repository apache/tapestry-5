 * Object providers represent an alternate way to locate an object provided somewhere in the

 * to a service within the Registry, object providers in different flavors are capable of vending,
 * or even creating, objects of disparate types from disparate sources.
 * <p>
 * Object providers are consulted in a strict order, and the first non-null result is taken.
 * <p>
 * In many cases, an object provider searches for additional annotations on the element (usually a
 * parameter, or perhaps a field) for which a value is required.
 * <p>
 * A default ObjectProvider uses {@link ObjectLocator#getService(Class)}.

/**
 * Manages a set of EasyMock mock objects. Used as a base class for test cases.
 *
 * Extends from {@link org.testng.Assert} to bring in all the public static assert methods without requiring extra
 * imports.
 *
 * Provides a common mock factory method, {@link #newMock(Class)}. A single <em>standard</em> mock control is used for
 * all mock objects. Standard mocks do not care about the exact order in which methods are invoked, though they are as
 * rigorous as strict mocks when checking that parameters are the correct values.
 *
 * This base class is created with the intention of use within a TestNG test suite; if using JUnit, you can get the same
 * functionality using {@link MockTester}.
 *
 * This class is thread safe (it uses a thread local to store the mock control). In theory, this should allow TestNG to
 * execute tests in parallel.
 *
 * This class was originally in the tapestry-ioc module as was moved to tapestry-test; the package name was not changed
 * to ensure backwards compatibility.
 * 
 * @see org.easymock.EasyMock#createControl()
 * @see org.apache.tapestry5.test.ioc.MockTester
 * @deprecated In 5.4, with no replacement

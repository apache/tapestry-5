Tapestry Test Utilities

  This library is just a couple of base classes to make it easier to build integration test suites around 
  {{{http://www.openqa.org/selenium/}Selenium}}.
  
  This library is currently based on Selenium 0.8.1.
  
  The strategy is to start, in process, a Selenimum Server (which, in turn, starts and manages a web browser),
  a Jetty instance (for the web browser to talk to), and a Selenium client (which talks to the server).
  
  The client is able to request URLs, fill in form data, click links, and make assertions about output
  and behavior.
  
Usage and Configuration

  The core part of this library is a base class for you to extend your tests cases from: 
  {{{../apidocs/org/apache/tapestry5/test/AbstractIntegrationTestSuite.html}AbstractIntegrationTestSuite}}.
  
  This class is responsible for starting an instance of Jetty to server your web application, as well
  as a copy of Selenium Server. It also implements the
  {{{http://release.openqa.org/selenium-remote-control/0.9.0/doc/java/}Selenium}} interface.
  
  You must inform the suite about the location of your web application. The default location is 
  <<<src/main/webapp>>> (as this is the default directory for storing a web application when building
  using Maven).  This can be changed by provided a public constructor for your test suite.
  
  Here's an example from one of the Tapestry modules:
  
     
----
package org.apache.tapestry5.spring;

import org.apache.tapestry5.test.AbstractIntegrationTestSuite;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;

public class TapestrySpringIntegrationTest extends AbstractIntegrationTestSuite
{
    public TapestrySpringIntegrationTest()
    {
        super("src/test/webapp");
    }
    
    @Test
    public void integration_test() throws Exception
    {
        open(BASE_URL);

        type("input", "paris in the springtime");
        clickAndWait("//input[@value='Convert']");

        assertFieldValue("input", "PARIS IN THE SPRINGTIME");
    }

    @Test
    public void access_to_spring_context() throws Exception
    {
        open(BASE_URL);

        assertTextPresent("[upcase]");
    }
}
----

  This is a very simple example, and demonstrates a mix of Selenium methods (such as open() and type()) and
  methods added by the AbstractIntegrationTestSuite base class (clickAndWait() and assertFieldValue()).
  
  Of course, a real integration test would contain many methods, and may need to single thread their execution, or
  even specify an execution order.
  
  In addition, the AbstractIntegrationTestSuite base class extends the normal exception reporting provided by Selenium; when a failure occurs inside Selenium server,
  a more detailed message, including the current page's HTML source, is reported to System.err.

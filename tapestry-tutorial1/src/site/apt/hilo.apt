Chapter 3: Implementing the Hi/Lo Guessing Game

  Let's start building the Hi/Lo Guessing game. 
  
  In the game, the computer selects a number between 1 and 10.  You try and guess the number, clicking links.
  At the end, the computer tells you how many guesses you required.
  
  We'll build it in small pieces, using the kind of iterative development
  that Tapestry makes so easy.
  
[hilo-flow.png] Page flow for Hi/Lo Game

  Our page flow is very simple, consisting of three pages: Start, Guess and GameOver.  The Start page introduces the application and includes
  a link to start guessing.  The Guess page presents the user with ten links, plus feedback such as "too low" or "too high".  
  The GameOver page tells the user how many guesses they took.
  
  Let's get to work on the Start page and template.
  
  <<src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/Start.html>>

    <h1>Hi/Lo Guess</h1>

    <p>I'm thinking of a number between one and ten ... </p>

    <p>
      <t:actionlink>Start guessing</t:actionlink>
    </p>

  </body>
</html>
----

  Here we've taken the template created by the quickstart archetype and changed it around to fit our needs. The ActionLink
  component will create a link that will trigger a method inside our Java class.  You can launch the application to try it out:
  
[hilo-start.png] Start page with Hi/Lo Game link

  However, clicking the link doesn't do anything yet.  We haven't told Tapestry what to do when the link gets clicked.
  
  Let's fix that. We'll change the Start class so that it will react when the link is clicked ... but what should it do?
  Well, to start the guessing process, we need to come up with a random number (between one and ten).  We need to tell
  the Guess page about that number, and we need to make sure the Guess page is started up to display the response.
  
  First, the Guess page.  Just to get started, we'll create a Guess page without much guessing: it'll just show us the 
  target number, the number we're supposed to be guessing.
  
  <<src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/Guess.html>>
  
----
<html xmlns:t="http://tapestry.apache.org/schema/tapestry_5_0_0.xsd">
  <head>
    <title>Guess A Number</title>
  </head>
  <body>

    <h1>The target number is ${target}.</h1>

  </body>
</html>
----

  On the Java side, the Guess page needs to have a target property:
  
----
package org.apache.tapestry.tutorial.pages;

public class Guess
{
  private int _target;

  void setup(int target)
  {
    _target = target;
  }
}
----

  The key method here is setup():  It is invoked to tell the Guess page what the target number is.  Notice that is is package private, not public; 
  it is only expected to be invoked from the Start page (as we'll see in a moment), so there's no need to make it public.  Later we'll see that
  there's more setup than just initializing the _target instance variable (which is why we don't name the method setTarget() ).
  
  <The naming convention, using leading underscores for fields, is NOT a requirement of Tapestry; that's
   just my personal coding style.>

  Now we can move back to the Start page.  What we want is to have the ActionLink component invoke a method on our page. We can then generate
  a random target number. We'll tell the Guess page what the target number is and then make sure is the the Guess page, and not the Start page,
  that renders the response into the user's web browser.  That's actually quite a few concepts to take in all at once.
  
  Let's start with the code, and break it down:
  
  <<src/main/java/org/apache/tapestry/tutorial/pages/Start.java>>
  
----
package org.apache.tapestry.tutorial.pages;

import java.util.Random;

import org.apache.tapestry.annotations.InjectPage;

public class Start
{
  private final Random _random = new Random();

  @InjectPage
  private Guess _guess;

  Object onAction()
  {
    int target = _random.nextInt(10) + 1;

    _guess.setup(target);

    return _guess;
  }
}
----
  
  What we're talking about here is <communication> of information from the Start page to the Guess page.  In traditional servlet development, this is done
  in a bizarre way ... storing attributes into the shared HttpSession object.  Of course, for that to work, both (or all) parties have to agree on the type
  of object stored, and the well-known name used to access the attribute.  That's the source of a large number of bugs.  It's also not very object oriented ... state
  is something that should be <inside> objects (and private), not <outside> objects (and public).
  
  The Tapestry way is very object oriented: everything is done in terms of objects and methods and properties of those objects.
  
  This communication starts with the connection between the two pages:  in this case, the InjectPage annotation allows another page in the application
  to be injected into the Start page.  
  
  Let's see what we do with this injected page.  It's used inside onAction().  You might guess that this method is invoked when the link ("Start guessing") is clicked.  But
  why?
  
  This is a strong example of <convention over configuration>. Tapestry has a naming convention for certain methods:  "on<EventType>[From<ComponentId>]".  Here, the event type 
  is "action" and the component id is not even specified. This translates to "when the action event is fired from any component, invoke this method".
  
  "The action event?"  This underlines a bit about how Tapestry processes requests. When you click a link generated by the ActionLink component, Tapestry is able
  to identify the underlying component inside the request: it knows that the component is on the Start page, and it knows the component within the page.  Here we didn't give
  the ActionLink component a specific id, so Tapestry supplied one.  An "action" event is triggered inside the ActionLink component, and that event bubbles
  up to the page, where the onAction() method acts as an <event handler method>.
  
  So ... ActionLink component --> action request --> onAction() event handler method.
  
  Event handler methods don't have to be public; they are usually package private (as in this example).  Also, it isn't an error if a request never matches
  an event handler. Before we added the onAction() event handler, that's exactly what happened; the request passed through without any event handler
  match, and Tapestry simply re-rendered the Start page.
  
  What can you do inside an event handler method?  Any kind of business logic you like; Tapestry doesn't care.  Here we're using a random number generator
  to set the target number to guess.
  
  We also use the injected Guess page; we invoke the setup() method to tell it about the number the user is trying to guess.
  
  The <return value> of an event handler method is very important; the value returned informs Tapestry about what page will render the response to the client.
  By returning the injected Guess page, we're telling Tapestry that the Guess page should be the one to render the response.
  
  Again, this is a big difference between Tapestry and servlets (or Struts). Tapestry tightly binds the controller (the Java class) to the template.
  Using JSPs, you would have extra configuration to select a view (usally by a logic name, such as "success") to a "view" (a JSP).  Tapestry cuts through
  all that cruft for you.
  
  In later chapters, we'll see other possibilities besides returning a page instance from an event handler method.
  
  For the moment, make sure all the changes are saved, and click the "Start guessing" link.
  
[hilo-exception.png] Exception on the Guess page

  This may not quite be what you were expecting ... but it is a useful digression into one of Tapestry's most important features: <<feedback>>.
  
  Something was wrong with the Guess page, and Tapestry has reported the error to you so that you can make a correction.
  
  Here, the root problem was that we didn't define a getTarget() method in the Start class.  Ooops.  Deep inside Tapestry, a RuntmeException was thrown to explain this.
  
  As often happens in frameworks, that RuntimeException was caught and rethrown wrapped inside a new exception, the TapestryException. This added a bit more detail to the exception
  message, and linked the exception to a <location>.  Since the error occurred inside a component template, Tapestry is able to display that portion of the
  template, highlighting the line in error.
  
  If you scroll down, you'll see that after the stack trace, Tapestry provides a wealth of information about the current request, including headers and query parameters.
  It also displays information stored in the HttpSession (if the session exists), and other information that may be of use.  
  
  Of course, in a production application,
  this information can be hidden!
  
  Let's fix this problem, by adding the following to the Guess class:
  
---
  public int getTarget()
  {
    return _target;
  }
---

* Persisting data between requests

  That fixes the problem, but introduces another:
  
[hilo-guess-v1.png] Hi/Lo Guess Page

  Why is the target number zero?  Didn't we set it to a random value between 1 and 10?
  
  At issue here is the how Tapestry organizes requests. Tapestry has two main types
  of requests: <<action>> requests and <<render>> requests. Render requests
  are easy, the URL includes just the page name, and that page is rendered out.
  
  Action requests are more complicated; the URL will include the name of the page
  and the id of the component within the page, and perhaps the type of event.
  
  After your event handler method is executed, Tapestry determine what page will
  render the response; as we've seen, that is based on the return value of
  the event handler method.
  
  Tapestry doesn't, however, render the response directly, the way most servlet
  applications would; instead it sends a <redirect URL> to the client web browser.
  The URL is a render request URL for the page that will render the response.
  
  You may have seen this before.  It is commonly called the <redirect after post pattern>. Most often,
  it is associated with form submissions (and as we'll see in later chapters, a form submission <is>
  another type of action request). 
  
  So why does that affect the target value?  At the end of any request (action or render), Tapestry
  will "clean house", resetting any instance variables back to their initial, default values (usually, null 
  or zero). 
  
  This cleaning is very necessary to the basic way Tapestry operates: pages are expensive entities to
  create; too expensive to create fresh each request, and too large and complicated to store in the HttpSession.
  Tapestry <pools> pages, using and reusing them in request after request.  
  
  For the duration of a single request from a single user, a <page instance> is <bound> to the request.
  It is only accessible to the one request. Other requests may be bound to other instances of the same page.
  The same page instance will be used for request after request. 
  
  So, inside the action request, the code inside the onAction() event handler method <did> call the
  setup() method, and a value between 1 and 10 was stored in the _target instance variable. But
  at the end of that request, the value was lost, and in the subsequent render request for the Guess page,
  the value was zero.
  
  Fortunately, it is very easy to transcend this behavior.  We'll use an annotation, @Persist,
  on the instance variable:
  
----
  @Persist
  private int _target;
----

  Now we can use the browser back button to return to the Start page, and click the link again.
 
[hilo-number.png] The target number
  
  One of the nice things about this approach, the user of redirects, is that hitting the refresh button
  does <not> choose a new target number.  It simply redraws the Guess page with the 
  target number previously selected. In many servlet applications, the URL would be for the action "choose a random number"
  and refreshing would re-execute that action.
  
* Creating guessable links

  Now it's time to start the game in earnest.  We don't want to just tell the user what the target number is,
  we want to make them guess, and we want to track how many attempts they take.
  
  What we want is to create 10 links, and combine those links with logic on the server side, an event handler method,
  that can interpret what value the user selected.
  
  Let's start with those links.  We're going to use a new component, Loop, to loop
  over a set of values:
  
  <<src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/Guess.html:>>
  
---
<html xmlns:t="http://tapestry.apache.org/schema/tapestry_5_0_0.xsd">
  <head>
    <title>Guess A Number</title>
  </head>
  <body>

  <p>Make a guess between one and ten:</p>
  
    <t:loop source="1..10" value="guess">
      <t:actionlink t:id="link" context="guess">${guess}</t:actionlink>
    </t:loop>

  </body>
</html>
---

  The Loop component's source attribute identifies the values to loop over.
  Often this is a list or array, but here the special
  special syntax, "1..10" means iterate over the numbers between 1 and 10, inclusive.
  
  The value attribute gets assigned the current item from the loop.  We'll use
  a property of the Guess page as a kind of scratchpad for this purpose:
  
---
  private int _guess;

  public int getGuess()
  {
    return _guess;
  }

  public void setGuess(int guess)
  {
    _guess = guess;
  }
---  

  The context parameter of the ActionLink is how we get extra information into
  the action request URL. The context can be a single value, or an array or
  list of values.  The values are converted to strings and tacked onto the action
  request URL.  The end result is <<<http://localhost:8080/tutorial1/guess.link/4>>>.  
  
  What is "guess.link"?  That's the name of the page, "guess", and the id of the component 
  ("link", as explicitly set with the t:id attribute).
  
  Now, to handle those guesses. We're going to add an event handler method that gets
  invoked when a link is clicked.  We're also going to add a new property, message, to
  store the message that says "too high" or "too low".
  
---
  @Persist
  private String _message;

  public String getMessage()
  {
    return _message;
  }

  String onActionFromLink(int guess)
  {
    if (guess == _target) return "GameOver";

    if (guess < _target)
      _message = String.format("%d is too low.", guess);
    else
      _message = String.format("%d is too high.", guess);

    return null;
  }
---  


  
  
  Here's the big news: Tapestry will convert the number from the URL back into
  an integer automatically, so that it can pass it in to this method as a parameter.
  We can then compare the guess from the user to the secret target number.
  

  We need to update the Guess page to actually display the message; this is done by adding the following:
  
---
  <p>${message}</p>
---

  This is truly bare bones and, when message is null, will output an empty \<p\> element.  A real application
  would dress this up a bit more (using CSS and the like to make it prettier).
  
  
  We do need a basic GameOver page.
  
  <<src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/GameOver.html:>>

---
<html xmlns:t="http://tapestry.apache.org/schema/tapestry_5_0_0.xsd">
  <head>
    <title>Game Over!</title>
  </head>
  <body>

    <h1>Game Over</h1>

    <p> You guessed the secret number!  </p>


  </body>
</html>
---

  <<src/main/java/org/apache/tapestry/tutorial/pages/GameOver.java:>>

---
package org.apache.tapestry.tutorial.pages;

public class GameOver
{

}
---

  With this in place, we can make guesses, and get feedback from the application:
  
[hilo-feedback.png] Feedback from the game

* Counting the number of guesses

 It would be nice to provide some feedback about how many guesses the
 user took to find the number.  That's easy enough to do.
 
 First we update Guess to store the number of guesses:
 
---
  @Persist
  private int _count;
---

  Next we modified setup() to ensure that _count is set to 0.  This is a safety
  precaution in case we add logic to play the game again.
  
---
  void setup(int target)
  {
    _target = target;
    _count = 0;
  }
--- 

  We have a couple of changes to make to the event handler method.  We want
  to communicate to the GameOver page the guess count; so we'll inject the
  GameOver page so we can initialize it.
  
---
  Object onActionFromLink(int guess)
  {
    _count++;

    if (guess == _target)
    {
      _gameOver.setup(_count);
      return _gameOver;
    }

    if (guess < _target)
      _message = String.format("%d is too low.", guess);
    else
      _message = String.format("%d is too high.", guess);

    return null;
  }
---

  So, we update the count before comparing and, instead of returning the
  name over the GameOver page, we return the configured instance.
  
  Lastly, we need to make some changes to the GameOver class.
  
  <<src/main/java/org/apache/tapestry/tutorial/GameOver.java:>>
  
---
package org.apache.tapestry.tutorial.pages;

import org.apache.tapestry.annotations.Persist;

public class GameOver
{
  @Persist
  private int _count;

  public int getCount()
  {
    return _count;
  }

  void setup(int count)
  {
    _count = count;
  }
}
---
  
  <<src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/GameOver.html:>>
  
---
<html xmlns:t="http://tapestry.apache.org/schema/tapestry_5_0_0.xsd">
  <head>
    <title>Game Over!</title>
  </head>
  <body>

    <h1>Game Over</h1>

    <p> You guessed the secret number in ${count} guesses!  </p>


  </body>
</html>
---

* Parting thoughts

  What we've gone after here is the Tapestry way: pages as classes that store
  internal state and communicate with each other. We've also seen the Tapestry
  development pattern: lots of simple small steps that leverage Tapestry's ability to
  reload templates and classes on the fly.
  
  We've also seen how Tapestry stores data for us, sometimes in the session
  (via the @Persist annotation) and sometimes in the URL.
  
  Our code is wonderfully free of anything related to HTTP or the Java Servlet API.
  We're coding using real objects, with their own instance variables and internal state.
  
  Our application is still pretty simple; here's a few challenges:
  
  * Add a restart link to the GameOver page to allow a new game to start. Can you refactor the application
  so that the code for the random number selection occurs in only one place?
  
  * As we guess, we're identifying ranges of valid and invalid numbers.  Can you only show valid
   guesses to the user?
   
  * What would it take to change the the game to choose a number between 1 and 20? Between 1 and 100?
  
  * What about setting an upper-limit on the number of guesses allowed?

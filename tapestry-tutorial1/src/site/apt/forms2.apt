 Forms in Tapestry
 ---
 
Chapter 5: Forms in Tapestry (Part Two)

  So, you fill in all the fields, submit the form (without validation errors) and voila:  you get back the same
  form, blanked out.  What happened, and where did the data go?

  What happened is that we haven't told Tapestry what to do after the form is succesfully submitted (by succesful, we mean,
  with no validation errors).  Tapestry's default behavior is to redisplay the active page, and that occurs in a new
  request, with a new instance of the Address object (because the address field is not a peristent field).

  Well, since we're creating objects, we might as well store them somewhere ... in a database.  We're going to
  quickly integrate Tapestry with {{{http://hibernate.org}Hibernate}} as the object/relational mapping layer,
  and ultimately store our data inside a {{{http://www.mysql.com/}MySQL}} database.  You'll have to download
  and install MySQL on your own.

  In addition, we need to create the database and user.  The database will be "t5_tutorial1" and
  the user will be "t5tutorialuser" with password "secret". This is accomplished from the
  command line using the mysql shell.

  The two commands are:

  *   create database t5_tutorial1;

  *   grant all on t5_tutorial1.* to 't5tutorialuser'@'localhost' identified by 'secret';

  []

  Log into the MySQL monitor shell as user root to execute the commands:

----
$ mysql -u root -p
Enter password:
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 4
Server version: 5.0.51a MySQL Community Server (GPL)

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

mysql> create database t5_tutorial1;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.08 sec)


mysql> grant all on t5_tutorial1.* to 't5tutorialuser'@'localhost' identified by 'secret';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

Re-configuring the Project

  We're going to bootstrap this project from a simple Tapestry project to one that uses Hibernate and MySQL.


* Updating the Dependencies

  First, we must update the POM to list a new set of dependencies, that includes Hibernate,
  the Tapestry/Hibernate integration library, and the MySQL JDBC driver.

* Hibernate Configuration

  Hibernate has a master configuration file used to store connection and other data.

  <<src/main/resources/hibernate.cfg.xml:>>

----
<!DOCTYPE hibernate-configuration PUBLIC
        "-//Hibernate/Hibernate Configuration DTD 3.0//EN"
        "http://hibernate.sourceforge.net/hibernate-configuration-3.0.dtd">
<hibernate-configuration>
    <session-factory>
        <property name="hibernate.connection.driver_class">com.mysql.jdbc.Driver</property>
        <property name="hibernate.connection.url">jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/t5_tutorial1</property>
        <property name="hibernate.dialect">org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect</property>
        <property name="hibernate.connection.username">t5tutorialuser</property>
        <property name="hibernate.connection.password">secret</property>
        <property name="hbm2ddl.auto">update</property>
        <property name="hibernate.show_sql">true</property>
        <property name="hibernate.format_sql">true</property>
    </session-factory>
</hibernate-configuration>
----


  Most of the configuration is to identify the JDBC driver and connection URL.

  In addition, we are configuring Hibernate to <update> the database schema; when Hibernate initializes
  it will create or even modify tables to match the entities.  Finally, we are configuring Hibernate
  to output any SQL it executes, which is very useful when initially building an application.

  But what entities?  Normally, the available entities are listed inside hibernate.cfg.xml, but that's not necessary
  with Tapestry; in another example of convention over configuration, Tapestry locates all entity classes
  inside the entities package and adds them to the configuration. Currently, that is just the Address entity.

Adding Hibernate Annotations

  For an entity class to be used with Hibernate, some Hibernate annotations must be added to the class.

  Below is the updated Address class, with the Hibernate annotations (as well as the Tapestry ones).  Hibernate
  annotations can be applied to fields or to accessor methods, but the Tapestry annotations we use below
  are for methods only.

Updating the Database

  So we have a database up and running, and Hibernate is configured to connect to it.  Let's make use of that
  to store our Address object in the database.

  What we need is to provide some code to be executed when the form is submitted.  When a Tapestry form
   is submitted, there is a whole series of events that get fired.  The event we are interested in is the "success"
   event, which comes late in the process, after all the values have been pulled out of the request and
   applied to the page properties, and after all server-side validations have occured.

   The success event is only fired if there are no validation errors.

  Our event handler must do two things:

  * Use the Hibernate Session object to persist the new Address object.

  * Commit the transaction to force the data to be written to the database.

  []

  <<src/main/java/org/apache/tapestry/tutorial/pages/address/CreateAddress.java:>>

----
package org.apache.tapestry.tutorial.pages.address;

import org.apache.tapestry.annotations.InjectPage;
import org.apache.tapestry.annotations.Property;
import org.apache.tapestry.hibernate.annotations.CommitAfter;
import org.apache.tapestry.ioc.annotations.Inject;
import org.apache.tapestry.tutorial.entities.Address;
import org.apache.tapestry.tutorial.pages.Index;
import org.hibernate.Session;

public class CreateAddress
{
    @Property
    private Address address;

    @Inject
    private Session session;

    @InjectPage
    private Index index;

    @CommitAfter
    Object onSuccess()
    {
        session.persist(address);

        return index;
    }
}
----

  The {{{../apidocs/org/apache/tapestry/ioc/annotations/Inject.html}Inject}} annotation tells Tapestry to inject a service into the
  annotated field; 
  Tapestry includes a sophisticated
  Inversion of Control container (similar in many ways to Spring) that is very good at locating available services
  by type, rather than by a string id.  In any case, the Hibernate Session object is exposed as a Tapestry IoC service,
  ready to be injected (this is one of the things provided by the tapestry-hibernate module).

  Tapestry automatically starts a transaction as necessary; however that transaction will be <aborted> at the end
  of the request.  If we make changes to persistent objects, such as adding a new Address object,
  then it is necessary to commit the transaction.

  The {{{../apidocs/org/apache/tapestry/hibernate/annotations/CommitAfter.html}CommitAfter}} annotation can be applied to any component method; if the method completes normally, the transaction
  will be committed (and a new transaction started to replace the committed transaction).

  After persisting the new address, we return to the main Index page of the application.

  <Note: In real applications, it is rare to have pages and components directly use the Hibernate Session. It
  is generally a better approach to define your own Data Access Object layer to perform common update operations
  and queries.>

Showing Addresses

  As a little preview of what's next, let's display all the Addresses entered by the user on the Index page
  of the application.  After you enter a few names, it will look something like:

[index-grid-v1.png] Adding the Grid to the Index page

  So, how is this implemented?  Primarily, its accomplished by the
  {{{../tapestry-core/ref/org/apache/tapestry/corelib/components/Grid.html}Grid}} component.

  The Grid component is based on the same concepts as the BeanEditForm component; it can pull apart
  a bean into columns. The columns are sortable, and when there are more entries than will fit on a single
  page, page navigation is automatically added.

  A minimal Grid is very easy to add to the template:

  <<src/main/webapp/Index.tml (partial):>>

----
  <t:grid source="addresses"/>
----

  And all we have to do is supply the addresses property in the Java code:

  <<src/main/java/org/apache/tapestry/tutorial/pages/Index.java (partial):>>

----
    @Inject
    private Session session;

    public List<Address> getAddresses()
    {
        return session.createCriteria(Address.class).list();
    }
----

  Here, we're using the Hibernate Session object to find all Address objects in the database.
  Any sorting that takes place will be done in memory.  This is fine for now (with only
  a handful of Address objects in the database). Later we'll
  see how to optimize this for very large result sets.
  
What's Next?

  We have lots more to talk about: more components, more customizations, built-in Ajax support,
  more common design and implementation patterns,
  and even writing your own components (which is easy!).

  ... but Tapestry and this tutorial are a work in progress, so stay patient, and check out
  the other Tapestry tutorials and resources available on the
  {{{../index.html}Tapestry 5 home page}}.

Development Environment

  Developing Tapestry requires the use of JDK 1.5.
  
  Effectively, you should have the following tools:
  
  * Maven 2.0.7
  
  * Ant 1.7.0
  
  * Eclipse 3.3.0
  
  * Eclipse Maven Plugin (install from http://m2eclipse.codehaus.org/) version 0.0.11
  
    * Version 0.0.11 is mandatory!  Things will not work without it.
   
Builds

  Tapestry 5 is built by Maven 2.
  
  You can build individual modules, or (from the root folder) build everything.

Tapestry Core

  The tapestry-core module provides the interfaces and annotations that form the Tapestry API.
  
  tapestry-core is built upon the {{{../tapestry-ioc/index.html}Tapestry IoC Container}}.

New And Of Note

  * Component methods may be marked with the @Log annotation, to enable debug logging of
    method entry (with parameters) and exit (with return value, or thrown exception).

  * It is now possible to provide method invocation advice to component methods. This opens up
    a very powerful Aspect Oriented Programming approach to Tapestry components.

  * The Exception Report page now identifies the version of the Tapestry framework, and lists
    out System properties (including the Java classpath).

  * The {{{ref/org/apache/tapestry5/corelib/components/Grid.html}Grid}} component can now update itself in place,
    using Ajax, when paging or sorting links are clicked.

  * Added a zone parameter to the  {{{ref/org/apache/tapestry5/corelib/components/BeanEditForm.;html}BeanEditForm}}
    component, to support Ajax updates.

  * The @Cached annotation has been added to allowing the caching of method results.

  * Tapestry can now generate accessor methods for fields automatically via the @Property annotation.

  * It is now possible to override the built-in display and edit blocks for data types.

  * Tapestry now supports "Index" pages at the root or in sub-folders.

  * Tapestry pages may now be {{{guide/secure.html}secured for access only via HTTPS}}.

  * Added the {{{ref/org/apache/tapestry5/corelib/components/FormFragment.html}FormFragment}} component
    to allow for forms that are mutable on the client-side. In addition, the
    {{{ref/org/apache/tapestry5/corelib/components/Form.html}Form}} component may
    now update a Zone.

  * Form components now trigger a "validateForm" event, not a "validate" event (so as to avoid conflict
    with the "validate" event triggered by TextFields).

  * Tapestry now understands JDK 1.5 Generics, allowing for simple parameterized types for properties of data objects and components.

  * Tapestry now differentiates between development mode and production mode, primarily in how
    it reports runtime exceptions.  It defaults to production mode.   

  * Components can now supply an event handler for type "exception" which will be invoked when
    an exception occurs in a component event handler method. This is useful for handling errors
    with the context for the "activate" event.

  * Page instances are now cached more efficiently, with Tapestry attempting to control how many instances
    are created, and culling unused instances periodically.

  * Component templates are stripped of unnecessary whitespace.

  * New Unless component (like an If component, but inverted).

  * Support for "password" and "longtext" data types (for use with the BeanEditor), and a new
    {{{ref/org/apache/tapestry5/corelib/components/TextOutput.html}TextOutput}} component.

  * The new "var:" binding prefix allows for temporary, untyped storage
    of render-time values without having to define a new component property.
 
Changes from Tapestry 4 to Tapestry 5

  Tapestry 5 represents a significant advance over Tapestry 4.  The goal is to make Tapestry 5
  <significantly> easier to use than Tapestry 4 (or any other Java web framework).
  We're keeping the <essence> of Tapestry 4, but starting with a brand new code base designed
  to provide a stable, powerful, extensible platform for many years to come.
  
  Here's a few of the planned and implemented features:

  * Easy to get started using Maven.
  
  * Simplified, minimal API based on annotations.
  
  * <<No>> base class requirement; components are true, pure Pojos (Plain Old Java Objects).
  
  * Abstract classes ... gone!  Classes are normal, concrete classes.
  
  * <<No>> XML descriptors for pages and components ... just the annotations.
  
  * Less configuration all around.
  
  * Automatic reloading of templates and even <Java classes>.
  
  * Super-duper Ajax integration built in.
  
  * Easy & fast unit testing of individual pages or components.
    
Adaptive API

  A key feature of Tapestry 5 is <adaptive API>.
  
  In traditional Java frameworks, including Tapestry 4, user code is expected to
  conform to the framework.  You create classes that extend from framework-provided
  base classes, or implement framework-provided interfaces.
  
  This works well until you upgrade to the next release of the framework: with
  the new features of the upgrade, you will more often than not experience breaks
  in backwards compatibility. Interfaces or base classes will have changed and your
  existing code will need to be changed to match.
  
  In Tapestry 5, the framework <adapts to your code>.  You have control over the
  names of the methods, the parameters they take, and the value that is returned. This
  is driven by annotations, which tell Tapestry under what circumstances your
  methods are to be invoked.
  
  For example, you may have a login form and have a method that gets invoked
  when the form is submitted:
  
+----+
public class Login
{
  @Persist
  @Property
  private String userId;
  
  @Property
  private String password;
  
  @Component
  private Form form;
  
  @Inject
  private LoginAuthenticator authenticator;
  
  void onValidateForm()
  {
    if (! authenticator.isValidLogin(userId, password))
    {
      form.recordError("Invalid user name or password.");
    }
  }

  Object onSuccess()
  {
    return PostLogin.class;
  }

}
+----+

  This short snippet demonstrates a bit about how Tapestry operates.  Pages and services
  within the application are injected with the @Inject annotation. The method names, onValidateForm()
  and onSuccess(),
  inform Tapestry about when the method is to be invoked.  The two events <validateForm> and <success> occur
  when a form is submitted; "validateForm" is triggered to perform cross-field validations, and "success" is
  only triggered when there are no validation errors. The onSuccess() method's 
  return value directs Tapestry on what to do next: jump to another page within the application
  (here identified as the class for the page, but many other options exist).  When there are exceptions,
  the page will be redisplayed to the user.

  This also represents a distinct change from Tapestry 4. In earlier versions of Tapestry, 
  the Form component's listener parameter would be bound to the method to invoke, by name.  Further,
  the listener method had to be public.
  This new approach not only support multiple listeners, but provides an improved separation of
  view concerns (inside the page's HTML template) and logic concerns, inside the Java class.
    
  In many cases, additional information about the event is available, and can be passed
  into the method by adding parameters to the method. Again, Tapestry will adapt
  to your parameters, in whatever order you supply them.

  Tapestry also saves you effort:  the @Property annotation marks a field as readable and writable;
  Tapestry will provide the accessor methods automatically.

  Finally, Tapestry 5 explicitly separates actions (requests that change things) and rendering (requests that
  render pages) into two separate requests.  Performing an action, such as clicking a link or submitting a form,
  results in a <client side redirect> to the new page. This is often called "redirect after post". This helps ensure
  that URLs in the browser are book-markable ... but also requires that a bit more information be stored in the session
  between requests (using the @Persist annotation).

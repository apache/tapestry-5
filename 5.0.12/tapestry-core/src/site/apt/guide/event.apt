Component Events

  Component events are the means by which components are made aware of behaviors by the user, such
  as clicking links and submitting forms.
  
  Component events are used for two purposes:
  
  * They represent requests initiated by the user, triggered by links and forms in the client web browser.
    These are described more fully in {{{pagenav.html}page navigation}} and in 
    {{{request.html}requst processing}}.
    
  * They represent flow-of-control within a request, allowing one component to notify its container
    about some kind of circumstance ("a form was submitted"), or to collect some piece for data
    from the container.
    
  []
  
  Often, a navigation request (originating with the user) will spawn a number of flow-of-control
  requests.  For example, a Form component will be triggered by an action request, and will then
  send notification events to announce when the form submission is about to be processed, and
  whether it was succesful or not.
  
  In Tapestry 4, you would configure a parameter of a component with the name of a method to invoke
  when a certain event occured, usually a request from the client.
  
  This has some limitations, including the fact that only a single method could be invoked, and that
  it tied together a component and a method based on a method name, which required careful coordination
  between the template and the Java code.
  
  Tapestry 5 introduces the concept of <event handler methods>, identified via a naming convention, or
  via the 
  {{{../../apidocs/org/apache/tapestry5/annotations/OnEvent.html}OnEvent annotation}}.  Event handler methods
  have any visibility, even private (normally they are given package private visibility, to support testing).
  
  Rather than configure a component to invoke a particular method, you identify one or more
  methods to listen for events from that component. A single event handler method may receive notifications from
  many different components.
  
  For example, here's a portion of a page (let's call it "Chooser") that lets the user choose a number between 1 and 10:
  
+---+
<p> Choose a number from 1 to 10: </p>

<p>
    <t:count end="10" value="index">
        <a t:id="select" t:type="actionlink" context="index">${index}</t:comp>
    </t:count>
</p>
+---+

  The ActionLink component creates an action URL.
  
  The URL identifies the page that contains the component ("chooser"), the type of event
  (unless it is "action", the default and most common event type),
  the id of the component within the page ("select"), plus the additional context value(s).
  
  A sample URL: <<<http://localhost:8080/chooser.select/3>>>.

  When there are additional context values, they are appended to the path.
  
  This demonstrates a critical difference between Tapestry and a more traditional, action oriented framework.
  This URL doesn't say what happens when the link is clicked, it identifies <which component is responsible>.

  There's no simple mapping from URL to a piece of code; instead the component sends notifications, in the form
  of invocations of event handler methods, and Tapestry ensures that the correct bit of code, that you supply,
  gts invoked.
  
   
  A Java method can be invoked when the link for the component is clicked by the user:
  
+---+
  @OnEvent(component = "select")
  void valueChosen(int value)
  {
    this.value = value;
  }
+---+

  Tapestry has done two things here:
  
  * It has identified method valueChosen() as the method to invoke.
  
  * It has converted the context value from a string to an integer and passed it into the method.
  
  []
  
  In the above example, the valueChosen() method will be invoked on the default event, "action", that originates
  in component <<<choose>>> (and has at least one context value).
  
  Some components can emit more than one type of event, in which case you will want to be more specific:
  
+---+
  @OnEvent(value = "action", component = "select")
  void valueChosen(int value)
  {
    this.value = value;
  }
+---+
  
  The value attribute of the OnEvent annotation is the name of the event to match.
  
  "action" is the name of the default event type; the ActionLink and Form components each use this event type.
  If you omit the component part of the OnEvent annotation, then you'll recieve notifications from
  <all> contained components, possibly including nested components (due to event bubbling).

  As elsewhere, the comparison of event type and component id is caseless.
  
  You should qualify exactly which component(s) you wish to recieve events from.   Using @OnEvent on a method
  and not specifying a specific component id means that the method will be invoked for events from <any> component.
  
Event Handler Method Convention Names
  
  As an alternative to the use of annotations, you may name your events in a specific fashion, and Tapestry will invoke your methods just as if
  they were annotated.  
  
  This style of event handler methods start with the prefix "on", followed by the name of the action.  You may then continue by adding "From" and
  a capitalized component id.
  
  The previous example may be rewritten as:
  
+---+
  void onActionFromSelect(int value)
  {
    this.value = value;
  }
+---+  

  Note from Howard: I've found that I prefer the naming convention approach, and reserve the annotation just for situations that don't otherwise fit.  
  
Event Handler Method Return Values
  
  For page navigation events, the value returned from an event handler method {{{pagenav.html}determines how Tapestry will render a response}}.

Multiple Method Matches

 In some cases, you may have multiple event methods match a single event.

 The order is as follows:

 * Base class methods before sub-class methods.

 * Matching methods within a class in alphabetical order.

 * For a single method name with multiple overrides, by number of parameters, descending.

 []

 There's only rare cases where it makes sense for more than one method to handle an event.

Event Context

  The context values (the context parameter to the ActionLink component) can be any object.
  However, only a simple conversion to string occurs.  This is in contrast to Tapestry 4, which had
  an elaborate type mechanism with the odd name "DataSqueezer".
  
  Again, whatever your value is (string, number, date), it is converted into a plain string.
  This results in a more readable URL.
  
  If you have multiple context values (by binding a list or array of objects to the ActionLink's
  context parameter), then each one, in order, will be added to the URL.
  
  When an event handler method is invoked, the strings are converted back into
  values, or even objects. A
  {{{../../apidocs/org/apache/tapestry5/ValueEncoder.html}ValueEncoder}} is used to convert between client-side strings
  and server-side objects.  The {{{../../apidocs/org/apache/tapestry5/services/ValueEncoderSource.html}ValueEncoderSource}} service
  provides the necessary value encoders.

* Method Matching

  An event handler method will only be invoked
    <if the context contains at least as many values as the method has parameters>.  Methods with too many parameters
    will be silently skipped.

* Collections

  To designate that an event handler method should be invoked regardless of how many context parameters are available,
  change the method to accept a <single> parameter of type Object[], type List, or
  {{{../../apidocs/org/apache/tapestry5/EventContext.html}EventContext}}.

Event Bubbling

  The event will bubble up the hierarchy, until it is aborted. The event is aborted
  when an event handler method returns a non-null value.

  Returning a boolean value from an event handler method is special.  Returning true will abort the event
  with no result; use this when the event is fully handled without a return value and no further event handlers
  (in the same component, or in containing components) should be invoked.

  Returning false is the same as returning null.

Event Method Exceptions

  Event methods are allowed to throw any exception (not just runtime exceptions). If an event method does
  throw an exception, Tapestry will catch the thrown exception and ultimately display the exception report
  page.

  In other words, there's no need to do this:

+---+
  void onActionFromRunQuery()
  {
    try
    {
      dao.executeQuery();
    }
    catch (JDBCException ex)
    {
      throw new RuntimeException(ex);
    }
  }
+---+

  Instead, you may simply say:

+---+
  void onActionFromRunQuery() throws JDBCException
  {
    dao.executeQuery();
  }
+----+


  Your event handler method may even declare that it "throws Exception" if that is more convienient.


Intercepting Event Exceptions

  When an event handler method throws an exception (checked or runtime), Tapestry gives the component and
  its containing page a chance to handle the exception, before continuing on to
  report the exception.

  Tapestry fires a new event, of type "exception", passing the thrown exception as the context.  In fact,
  the exception is wrapped inside a
  {{{../../apidocs/org/apache/tapestry5/runtime/ComponentEventException.html}ComponentEventException}}, from which
  you may extract the event type and context.

  Thus:

---
  Object onException(Throwable cause)
  {
    message = cause.getMessage();

    return this;
  }
---

  The return value of the exception event handler <replaces> the return value of original event handler method.
  For the typical case (an exception thrown by an "activate" or "action" event), this will be
  a {{{pagenav.html}navigational response}} such as a page instance or page name.

  This can be handy for handling cases where the data in the URL is misformatted.

  In the above example, the navigational response is the page itself.

  If there is no exception event handler, or the exception event handler returns null (or is void), then
  then the exception will be passed to the
  {{{../../apidocs/org/apache/tapestry5/services/RequestExceptionHandler.html}RequestExceptionHandler}} service,
  which (in default configuraton) will be render the exception page.

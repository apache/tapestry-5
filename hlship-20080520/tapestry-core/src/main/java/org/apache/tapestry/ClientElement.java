/**
 * Interface for any kind of object (typically, a component) that can provide a {@linkplain #getClientId() client-side
 * id}, typically used in the generation of client-side (JavaScript) logic. For components, the client id will be null

 * only accurate just after the component has rendered, and before it renders again.
 * <p/>
 * Some components must be configured to provide a client id. In many cases, the client id matches the component's
 * {@linkplain ComponentResourcesCommon#getId() component id}, typically passed through {@link
 * RenderSupport#allocateClientId(String)} to ensure uniqueness.

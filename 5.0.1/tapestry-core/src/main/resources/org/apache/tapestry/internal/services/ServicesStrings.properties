duplicate-contribution=Contribution %s (as '%s') duplicates existing contribution %s and has been ignored.
infrastructure-mode-not-set=The infrastructure mode has not been set. Unable to determine the correct set of infrastructure properties.
infrastructure-property-not-found=No infrastructure property '%s' has been configured. Configured properties are: %s.
infrastructure-property-wrong-type=Property '%s' (%s) is not assignable to type %s.
markup-writer-no-current-element=This markup writer does not have a current element. \
  The current element is established with the first call to element() and is \
  maintained across subsequent calls. 
no-constructor-found=Unable to find an applicable constructor for class %s.
missing-declared-field=Class %s does not contain a field named '%s'.
error-adding-method=Error adding method %s to class %s: %s 
field-already-claimed=Field %s of class %s is already claimed by %s and can not be claimed by %s.
no-declared-method=Class %s does not declare method '%s'.
incorrect-class-for-instantiator=Unable to create a component instantiator for class %s because class %s was provided instead.
class-not-transformed=Class %s was not transformed for use as a component; \
  either it does not have the @ComponentClass annotation, or was not in a package subject to component transformation.
new-parser-error=Failure obtaining a SAX parser for resource %s: %s
missing-template-resource=Template resource %s does not exist.
template-parse-error=Failure parsing template %s: %s
content-inside-body-not-allowed=Content inside a Tapestry body element is not allowed (at %s). The content has been ignored.

render-queue-error=Render queue error in %s: %s
read-only-field=Field %s.%s is read-only.
no-injection-found=Could not find a suitable object to inject into %s.%s (type %s). \
  Use the value attribute of the @Inject annotation to identify exactly what should be injected into this field.
non-private-fields=Class %s contains field(s) (%s) that are not private. Tapestry will ignore these fields, even if they \
  have annotations. Runtime behavior, especially in production, may not be what you expect. \
  You should change these fields to private, and add accessor methods if needed.  
comp-requires-id-or-type=The <comp> element requires either an id or a type attribute to be specified.
mixins-invalid-without-id-or-type=You may not specify mixins for element <%s> because it does not represent a component (which requires either an id attribute or a type attribute).
comp-type-conflict=Embedded component '%s' provides a type attribute in the template ('%s') as well as in the component class ('%s'). \
  You should not provide a type attribute in the template when defining an embedded component within the component class.
no-type-for-embedded-component=Embedded component '%s' has no type. You should specify a type in the component template, \
  or define the component inside class %s using the @Component annotation on a private instance variable.
embedded-components-not-in-template=Embedded component(s) %s are defined within component class %s, but are not present in the component template.
binding-source-failure=Could not convert '%s' into a component parameter binding: %s
page-does-not-exist=Page '%s' is not defined by this application.

could-not-resolve-page-name=Unable to resolve page '%s' to a component class name.
could-not-resolve-component-type=Unable to resolve component type '%s' to a component class name.
could-not-resolve-mixin-type=Unable to resolve mixin type '%s' to a component class name.
parameter-name-must-be-unique=Parameter names are required to be unique.  Parameter '%s' already has the value '%s'.
page-is-dirty=Page %s is dirty, and will be discarded (rather than returned to the page pool).
component-instance-is-not-a-page=Method %s (for component %s) returned component %s, which is not a page component. The page containing the component will render the client response.

unknown-asset-prefix=Unknown prefix for asset path '%s'.
asset-does-not-exist=Unable to locate asset '%s' (the file does not exist).

undefined-tapestry-element=Element <%s> is in the Tapestry namespace, but is not a recognized Tapestry template element.

 About Tapestry/Hibernate

Tapestry/Hibernate Integration Library

  This library integrates into Tapestry 5 to provide out-of-the-box support for using Hibernate 3 as the backend for
  normal CRUD style applications.
  
  For at least the first pass, this will represent access to the native Hibernate interfaces, exposed in a
  thread-safe manner, within a <session-per-request> strategy.
  
  A number of more esoteric ideas in Hibernate are not supported, including nested transactions and supporting multiple
  persistence units. 
  
Licensing Issues

  Hibernate is licensed under the Lesser GNU Public License. This is more restrictive license than the Apache Software
  License used by the rest of Tapestry. The restrictions mostly apply to redistricuting Hibernate, especially in
  any altered form, and will likely be irrelvant to the vast majority of users, but you should be aware.
  
  This library is compiled against version <<3.2.2.ga>> of Hibernate (and version 3.2.1.ga of hibernate-annotations),
  but should work with more recent versions.
  
  You will have to manually setup a dependency against your preferred version of Hibernate in your project's Maven POM,
  to override the default dependencies provided by tapestry-hibernate.

What's New?

  * Transactions are now <aborted> (no longer <committed>) at the end of each request: you must now
    explicitly commit the transaction if changes are to be saved.

  * The new @CommitAfter annotation for component and service methods can now commit the transaction
    automatically after the method is invoked.

  * {{{../apidocs/org/apache/tapestry5/hibernate/HibernateGridDataSource.html}HibernateGridDataSource}} can be used
    with the Grid component to support optimized queries against large data sets.

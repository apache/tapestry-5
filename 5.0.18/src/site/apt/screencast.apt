  Screencasts are a great way to learn about a new tool or framework without having to download
  a single thing to your computer.

  <<These screencasts reflect the rapid evolution of the framework. Many things have changed and simplfied over the last few weeks and months. Watch these
  in the manner intended ... as a preview of the flavor of Tapestry 5, not a reference for how to do things.>>

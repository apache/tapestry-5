Release Checklist

  Quick notes on how to prepare a new release of Tapestry.
  
Preparation

  Send an announcement to the list, asking them to hold off on trunk checkins.
  
  Make <<sure>> (<<sure!>>) you have the latest copies of tapestry-project and all of the modules.
  
Bumping the Version Number

  At this point, the version number of the tapestry-project POM is 5.0.x-SNAPSHOT. 
  Modules inherit their version number from the tapestry-project POM version number.
  
  The first step is to bump up those numbers to the final release value.
  
  * Edit tapestry-project/pom.xml, and change the \<version\> value (at the top of the file).  Change it from <<<5.0.x-SNAPSHOT>>> to <<<5.0.x>>>.
  
  * In each module, change the <parent> pom.xml \<version>\ field to point to the new tapestry-project POM version (<<<5.0.x>>>).
  
  	 * quickstart
  	 
		* The version number is also mentioned in <<quickstart/src/site/apt/index.apt>>, change it there.
  
		* <<quickstart/src/main/resources/archetype-resources/pom.xml>> contains a copy of the version number, <<at the bottom>> of the file.
  	 
  	 * tapestry-component-report
  	 
  	 * tapestry-core
  	 
  	 * tapestry-hibernate
     
  	 * tapestry-ioc
  	 
  	 * tapestry-spring
  	 
  	 * tapestry-test
  	 
  	 * tapestry-tutorial1
  	 
  	 []
    
  * From tapestry-project, execute <<<mvn clean install>>>; this should take a couple of minutes.
  
Generate the Release Notes

  JIRA has the ability to generate release notes automatically (this is why it is so important to keep the fix version number accurate).
  
  {{{https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ConfigureReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10573}https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ConfigureReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10573}}
  
  Select the correct version, in HTML format.
  
  Paste the notes to the <<top>> of tapestry-project/src/site/xdoc/release-notes.xdoc
  
  Wrap the title ("Release Notes - Tapestry - Version 5.0.x") inside an \<h1\> element.
  
Build and Deploy Site

  From tapestry-project, execute <<<mvn site site:deploy>>>
  
  This will build the project site and each of the module sites.  The sites go to a server that is periodically copied over to the live server; it can take up to an hour
  for changes to show up.
  
Build and Deploy Artifacts

  From tapestry-project, execute <<<mvn deploy>>>
  
  This will deploy the tapestry-project POM and each of the module's JARs (including source JARs).
  
  Since the version number is not longer -SNAPSHOT, it will be published to the Tapestry Snapshot Repository ({{{http://people.apache.org/~hlship/tapestry-snapshot-repository/}http://people.apache.org/~hlship/tapestry-snapshot-repository/}}).
  Once the vote on the release is approved, the files will be moved from there to the Apache Ibiblio Sync directory, and from there to the world.
  
  In addition, the Tapestry project site will be updated with all the new documentation.
  
  This takes 10 - 15 minutes. There's a whole lot of FTP-ing and SSH-ing going on.  Maven tends to run the test suites repeatedly, which is a
  bummer (that tapestry-core suite starts up Firefox and Selenium and takes about a minute to run each time).
  
Binary / Source Distributions

  An Ant script is used to build traditional binary and source distributions.  It requires Ant <<1.7.0>>.
  
  From the tapestry-project directory,    
  
  
Commit Changes

  Commit changes to tapestry-project and all modules.
  
Tag In Subversion

  For tapestry-project and each module, you must tag the release.
  
  You do this with SVN, copying the trunk folder to tags/releases/5.0.x.  The SVN tags/releases folder must
  already exist, the specific folder must not.

  I do this from Eclipse, but the command line (for example) is pretty straight forward (and I may create a script to help with this):
    
  <<<copy -rHEAD https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tapestry/tapestry5/trunk https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tapestry/tapestry5/tags/releases/5.0.x>>>
    
Add The Next Release to JIRA

  Use:
  
  {{{https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/project/ManageVersions.jspa?pid=10573}https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/project/ManageVersions.jspa?pid=10573}}
  
  to add the next release.  Any bugs that are fixed will be tagged with this new version number (5.0.x + 1).  Example: after building out 5.0.3, create 5.0.4.    
  Schedule it above the existing version.
  
  While you're there, use the <<Release>> option for the previous release; this ensures that any existing bugs are not marked as pending for the release,
  and sets the date of release in JIRA.
  
Binary Distributions

    Next we have to put together the binary distribution. This applys the the main modules, but not the Maven support (since by definition, Maven users will acquire 
    those files from the Maven repository).  Currently this is: tapestry-ioc, tapestry-core, tapestry-hibernate, tapestry-spring and tapestry-test.
    
    I use a couple of shell aliases to help:
    
+---+
alias gatherdist='for i in tapestry-ioc tapestry-core tapestry-test tapestry-spring tapestry-hibernate ; do  echo $i; cp ../$i/target/*.gz ../$i/target/*.bz2 ../$i/target/*.zip target ; done'
alias scpdist='scp target/*.zip target/*.gz target/*.bz2 target/*.asc target/*.md5 hlship@people.apache.org:/www/www.apache.org/dist/tapestry/'
alias signdist='for i in target/*.zip target/*.gz target/*.bz2; do echo $i; gpg --armor --detach-sig $i; md5 -r $i > $i.md5; done'
+---+
           
    Gather the files to be distributed together.  From the tapestry-project folder, execute <<<gatherdist>>>.  This uses the Maven assembly:assemlby goal to build distributions (binary and
    source archives in .zip, .tar.gz, and .tar.bz2 formats).

  Next, sign the distributions using <<signdist>>>.  You will have to type in you GnuPG pass phrase <for each file> (sorry! --- I copy it to the clipboard and paste it the
  dozen or so times).  This creates a .asc and a .md5 for  each distribution file.
  
  Next, copy the distributions to the Apache site using <<scpdist>>.
  
Wait 24 Hours

	It takes up to 24 hours for all the mirrors to sync, to don't go announcing the new release just yet.
	
Update the Downloads Page

 	The downloads page is inside the tapestry-site project as,  src/site/apt/download.apt.
 	
 	If you should edit the large block concerning Tapestry 5, updating the version number. There is no need (at least until we have a final release of Tapestry 5) to keep the links
 	to the old version number.
 	
 	After making the changes, and checking it in to Subversion, you can build and deploy the site.
  
Advance the Version Numbers

	This is optional but is useful, go find all those version numbers again and set them to 5.0.(n+1)-SNAPSHOT.  So, if you just release 5.0.3, set all the version numbers to 5.0.4-SNAPSHOT.
